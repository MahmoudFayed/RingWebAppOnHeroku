[![Mentioned in Awesome C](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge-flat.svg)](https://github.com/kozross/awesome-c)

Rogueutil is a cross-platform C/C++ (Windows and *nix at least) utility for
creating text-based user interfaces (TUI) and console-based games.

# Quick Start
Simply include `rogueutil.h` somewhere in your source code. It will automatically detect your platform
and whether you are using C or C++.

# Documentation
Either read the source code for the comments or see the [API reference](https://sakhmatd.github.io/rogueutil/html/rogueutil_8h.html).
